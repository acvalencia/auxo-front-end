## Quick improvements

* Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
  * Yeah sure, for example, I can add something else to improve the modularity of the project
  * Another thing to do here, redux or use context to handle the state of the application
  * Create the types for colors, labels and add more attributes to the tailwind config
  * Add the responsive design to the application


* What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  * Implement TypeScript to create types and interfaces
  * improve the design of the interface
  * Deploy everything
  * Create the float button for the filter buttons
